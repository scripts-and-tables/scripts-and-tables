# Oleksandr Tverdokhlieb

Data Analytics Manager | SQL • Python • Power BI | Dubai, UAE

I build reliable analytics products end-to-end: from messy source files and databases to automated pipelines, governed datasets, and decision-ready dashboards. My work typically sits at the intersection of business operations and engineering—turning manual reporting and fragmented processes into scalable, auditable systems.

---

## What I do

- **Analytics leadership:** manage and coach analysts, set SLAs/KPIs, improve delivery quality and ownership.
- **Data engineering (pragmatic):** ingestion from Excel/CSV/APIs, cleaning, validation rules, automation, scheduling.
- **BI & semantic models:** Power BI models and reports used by management and large user groups.
- **Automation:** Python orchestration scripts, monitoring, email notifications, and repeatable refresh workflows.
- **Process digitization:** lightweight web tools (often Python/Django) that replace manual inputs and spreadsheet chaos.

## Core skills

**Languages & Querying**
- Python (pandas, automation, APIs, web scraping)
- SQL (performance tuning, complex queries, data modeling)

**BI / Reporting**
- Power BI (DAX, modeling, governance, report performance)

**Data & Storage**
- SQLite / Postgres (and other relational concepts)
- File-based pipelines (Excel/CSV/JSON), data quality checks, reproducible transformations

**Automation & Tooling**
- CLI tools, schedulers, Windows-based automation
- Git / GitHub workflows (branching, pull requests, repo hygiene)

---

## Selected project themes (what you’ll find across my repos)

- **Synthetic data generation** for demos, testing, and analytics prototyping when real data cannot be shared  
- **CRM / sales analytics**: customer segmentation, cohort behavior, basket logic, retention signals  
- **Operational reporting automation**: consolidate multi-source inputs, validate, load, publish, notify  
- **Data quality tooling**: rule-based validation, anomaly detection, consistent column normalization for “real-world messy Excel”  
- **Web interfaces for business processes**: controlled inputs, approvals, audit logs, and API access

---

## How I work

- Prefer **simple, maintainable solutions** over over-engineering.
- Value **data quality and auditability**: clear transformations, repeatable runs, and traceability.
- Focus on **business outcomes**: reduce manual effort, accelerate decisions, and improve reliability.
- Write documentation so others can onboard quickly and operate with confidence.

---

## Repository navigation (typical)

Most of my projects follow a simple pattern:

- `src/` – core code (pipelines, business logic, utilities)
- `data/` – sample inputs (or placeholders if data cannot be shared)
- `output/` – generated exports (often gitignored)
- `README.md` – usage, assumptions, and examples

If a project uses a local database (`*.db`, `*.sqlite`), it is usually excluded from Git history unless it is fully synthetic and reproducible.

## Notes

If you are reviewing this repository for hiring or collaboration:
- I’m happy to clarify assumptions, dataset design decisions, or architecture trade-offs.
- Where real company data cannot be shared, you will see **synthetic datasets** that preserve structure and realism without exposing confidential information.
